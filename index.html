    <p>Sure! Here's a paragraph in sentence format about **HTML**HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It uses tags like , and `<a>` to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, and links. HTML forms the backbone of all websites, allowing browsers to display content properly. It works together with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. Every HTML document starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>` and includes the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` sections.
